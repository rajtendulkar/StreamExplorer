/**
 * package contains classes to build a model from the hardware platform.
 * A platform model consists of components such as clusters, processors, 
 * network links etc. 
 * 
 * We don't use this model very extensively, but use only some parameters
 * of it. We had a vision to perform communication scheduling and network
 * route selection. However, the work remains incomplete. If required, these
 * classes can be discarded easily.
