/**
 * package contains a group of tests in order to check different parts of this tool.
 * It provides some basic tests to test the algorithm if they work correctly or not.
 * 
 * In every test, we have an input and expected result. We should execute the algorithm
 * and then check if the result matches the expected ones. If not, throw an exception.
 * All the tests can be executed directly from {@link tests.TestCompiler} class which calls
 * the top-level procedure for each of these tests.
